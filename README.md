# Handwritten digit recogniser by tensorflow.

## Description

### This is a study project which sort handwritten digits. I used libraries tensorflow, keras, numpy and for visualization of graphs - matplotlib.

### Architecture:
* Fully connected neural network with 128 hidden neurons;
* Functions of activation - ReLu, Softmax;
* Optimizer - SGD with learning rate 0.01;
* Loss function - categorical crossentropy;

### Finally I've got result 97,5% correct identifications.
